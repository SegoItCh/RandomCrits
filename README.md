# RandomCrits

Minecraft 1.19.3 Spigot plugin that gives ability to you and mobs make critical strikes

This is what game needed in my opinion, I like play it more like Action RPG, than building/mining simulator
Passively working on implementing turning off forcing critical strikes(when you fall/jump)
